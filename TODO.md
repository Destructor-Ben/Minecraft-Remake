# To Do List

- Make the libraries submodules instead of directly embedded
- Gracious shutdown - Let os terminate the process using SIGTERM and SIGINT
- Remove tick thread, maybe just make a render thread or just keep single threaded

- Fix the `class World m_World` all around the place
- Probably do this by making Game.cpp a singleton class
- Reorganise LITERALLY EVERYTHING
