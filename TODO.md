# To Do List

- Make the libraries submodules instead of directly embedded
- Embed resources - use source generator https://stackoverflow.com/a/71906177/12259381
- Transparency & blending
- Implement an ECS for entities and blocks
- Entities
- Make all chunk loops that use radii circle instead of squares
- Maybe make chunk positions (origins) their center instead of corner
    - Blocks already are, also check that they are done correctly
- Why is it so laggy when under the world?
